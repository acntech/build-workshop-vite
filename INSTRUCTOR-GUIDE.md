**Key Teaching Points**:
- How build tools provide immediate feedback
- Reading error messages and stack traces
- Understanding line numbers and context

**Files to Use**:

- Guide them through fixing it

### Phase 5: Styling and Bootstrap (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Add external CSS framework

**Key Teaching Points**:
- How CSS dependencies work in bundlers
- Import order matters
- CSS modules vs global CSS

**Files to Use**:
- Install Bootstrap
- Switch to `src/App-with-styling.js`
- Use `src/App-styled.css`

### Phase 6: Linting Setup (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Introduction to code quality tools

**Key Teaching Points**:
- What linting is and why it's important
- Different types of rules (errors vs warnings)
- Team coding standards

**Files to Use**:
- Install ESLint and plugins
- Set up `.eslintrc.json`

### Phase 7: Fixing Linting Issues (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Practice fixing code quality issues

**Key Teaching Points**:
- Reading linting output
- Automatic vs manual fixes
- Understanding different rule types

**Files to Use**:
- Switch to `src/App-with-linting-issues.js`
- Run `npm run lint`
- Fix issues step by step
- Show `src/App-linting-fixed.js` as solution

### Phase 8: Production Build (20 minutes)
**Objective**: Understand the build process

**Key Teaching Points**:
- Development vs production builds
- Minification and optimization
- Bundle analysis

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Command not found" errors**:
```bash
# Check if Node.js is in PATH
echo $PATH
# or on Windows
echo $env:PATH
```

**Permission errors on npm install**:
```bash
# Fix npm permissions on macOS/Linux
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
```

**Port already in use**:
```bash
# Use different port
npm start -- --port 3001
```

**Build failures**:
1. Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
2. Reinstall: `npm install`
3. Check for syntax errors in recent changes

### Debugging Steps for Participants

1. **Read the error message carefully**
   - Look for file names and line numbers
   - Pay attention to the error type

2. **Check recent changes**
   - What was the last thing you modified?
   - Can you undo it to see if the error goes away?

3. **Use the browser console**
   - Open Developer Tools
   - Check for JavaScript errors

4. **Check the terminal output**
   - Build tools show detailed error information
   - Don't ignore warnings

## Extension Activities

For participants who finish early:

1. **Add a new API endpoint**
   - Find a free API online
   - Add it to the application

2. **Implement additional ESLint rules**
   - Add Prettier for formatting
   - Set up pre-commit hooks

3. **Explore the build output**
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Examine the generated files
   - Use bundle analyzer tools

## Assessment Ideas

### Quick Knowledge Checks
- What's the difference between `npm install` and `npm install --save-dev`?
- How do you fix a linting error vs a warning?
- What happens when you run `npm run build`?

### Practical Exercises
- Add a new dependency to the project
- Fix a deliberately introduced syntax error
- Configure a new ESLint rule
